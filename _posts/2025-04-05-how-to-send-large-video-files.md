## Why Large Video Files Are Hard to Share

Sending big video files isn‚Äôt easy. Most platforms have file size limits:

- Email attachments max out around 25MB  
- Discord only allows 10MB (without Nitro)  
- WeTransfer caps free transfers at 2GB  
- Google Drive takes ages to upload, and you risk hitting storage limits  

If you're sending videos from your computer, you need a tool that can handle massive files **without compression, without limits, and without stress.**
