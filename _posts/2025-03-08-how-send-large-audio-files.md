As a hobby music producer, I need to share large WAVs but struggle with existing services. 

Discord's 50MB limit frustrated me. Google Drive, MEGA, and Dropbox felt cumbersome. **I didn't need to store files permanently, just transfer them.** 

Many others feel the same.

Let's compare some popular solutions on the market: [Transfer.zip](https://transfer.zip/), [WeTransfer](https://wetransfer.com/), [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/), and [Smash](https://fromsmash.com/).

## Comparison
---
### **1. Transfer.zip**

[Transfer.zip](https://transfer.zip/) is an innovative, open-source file-sharing site offering **unlimited file size** for free. 

What sets it apart is its direct peer-to-peer transfer, meaning data is sent straight between the sender and receiver without storing files on a server. 

This allows for files of any size to be shared as long as both parties keep their browsers open during the transfer. 

This method guarantees privacy and removes storage limits, catering **especially to those who need temporary file sharing**.

**Pros:**
- Unlimited file size sharing
- Direct peer-to-peer transfers ensure privacy
- No server storage required

**Cons:**
- Requires both parties to keep browsers open
- Quick-Share may not be as stable as other stored options

### **2. WeTransfer**

WeTransfer is a well-known service that allows sending files up to 3GB for free, with premium plans offering larger limits and additional features like password protection. 

Files are stored on WeTransfer's servers for a limited time, which can be a downside for users looking to avoid storage or third-party interference.

It's user-friendly for those needing simple, temporary file sharing with a more structured approach to handling file uploads.

**Pros:**
- Easy to use with a simple interface
- Allows for 3GB file transfers for free

Google Drive provides 15GB of free storage shared across all Google services, allowing file sharing via links. 

It's highly integrated with Google Workspace tools, making it a versatile option for users heavily reliant on Google's ecosystem. 

While ideal for permanent storage and collaborative work, it often feels cumbersome for those only needing quick file transfers without the need for storage.

**Pros:**
- 15GB free storage
- Integrated with Google Workspace tools for collaboration
- Secure and reliable

**Cons:**
- Requires a Google account

Smash is another alternative for sending large files, offering unlimited size uploads with a free account, though the speed of downloads can vary.

It's user-friendly with a simple interface, tailored for users who don't require extensive storage but prefer more flexible size limits without account requirements.

**Pros:**
- Unlimited file size uploads
- No account required for usage

### **Conclusion**

For users seeking an easy, unlimited, and free solution without storage, **[Transfer.zip](https://transfer.zip/)** is a standout. Its peer-to-peer approach ensures privacy and flexibility.
