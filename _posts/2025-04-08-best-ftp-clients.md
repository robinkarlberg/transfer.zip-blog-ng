## Why You Still Need a Good FTP Client in 2025

Even with modern cloud storage, FTP remains essential for:

- Uploading website files to servers
- Managing remote directories
- Transferring large amounts of data efficiently

Whether you’re a developer, sysadmin, or just managing your own site, a solid FTP client saves time and reduces errors.

## 🔒 Are FTP Clients Secure?

Traditional FTP is **not encrypted**, but most modern clients support:

- **FTPS** (FTP over SSL/TLS)
- **SFTP** (SSH File Transfer Protocol)

These secure alternatives help protect your files and credentials.
