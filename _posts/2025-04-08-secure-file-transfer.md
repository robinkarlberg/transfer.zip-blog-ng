## Why Secure File Transfer Matters

In 2025, sending files has never been easier‚Äîbut also never riskier. Whether you're sharing sensitive documents, private videos, or project files, **your data deserves protection**.

Cloud platforms often scan files, log metadata, or keep your uploads indefinitely. If you care about privacy, you need **end-to-end security** and minimal third-party exposure.

Below are three reliable, secure methods‚Äîeach suited for different technical skill levels.

### 2. **SCP (Secure Copy via SSH)**

**Encrypted command-line transfer for Linux/macOS pros.**

SCP is a powerful way to securely transfer files between two systems using **SSH (Secure Shell)**. It's built into most UNIX-like systems and requires terminal access.

**Note:** Files are stored on the destination server, which may not be fully private depending on server configuration.

**Example command:**

```bash
scp file.txt user@remotehost:/destination/path
```

**Security features:**

- ‚úÖ Encrypted in transit via SSH
- ‚úÖ Direct machine-to-machine transfer

**Best for:** Developers, sysadmins, or anyone comfortable with the terminal.

**Drawbacks:**

- ‚ùå Not beginner-friendly
- ‚ùå Requires SSH setup on both devices

---

### 3. **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**

**Basic file transfer method with opt-in security.**

FTP is a legacy  way to browse, upload, and download files using an interactive terminal or GUI client (like Cyberduck or FileZilla).

**Note:** Files are stored on the remote server, so ensure it's properly secured and access-controlled.

**How it works:**

- Connect to a remote server via FTP client
- Authenticate using username+password
- Drag, drop, or script file transfers easily

**Security features:**

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Typically not encrypted unless using FTPS
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Username and password often sent in plain text

**Best for:** Users working with public content or legacy systems, where high security is not critical.

**Drawbacks:**

- ‚ùå Requires FTP server
- ‚ùå Needs setup and user access control
