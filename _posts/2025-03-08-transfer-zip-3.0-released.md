## First, a Thank You ‚ù§Ô∏è

We just wanted to say thank you for your patience and support over the last two years. 

In this time, Transfer.zip has gone from just being a simple single-page tool, to becoming a fully capable file transfer platform.

A lot of hard work has went into this, making sure you get the best experience possible, but we could not have done it without our users.

So thank you, and let's achieve great things together! \- Robin, Founder

Your recipients will receive an elegant email that includes the title and message of the transfer, accompanied by a convenient link for downloading.

### New and Updated Tools

The [Unzip Files](https://transfer.zip/tools/unzip-files-online) and [Zip Files](https://transfer.zip/tools/zip-files-online) tools got a revamp, with some bugs fixed, and a new design. 

We also introduced a new tool - [HEIC to JPG Converter](https://transfer.zip/tools/heic-convert)! üôå

##### What is HEIC format, and why is a converter needed?

HEIC, which stands for High Efficiency Image Format, is a file format that was introduced by Apple in iOS 11. It allows for efficient compression of images without compromising on quality. 

However, compatibility issues arise because not all devices and platforms support HEIC files, especially older devices or software that hasn't been updated to support the format. This is why a converter is sometimes needed.

### The New Dashboard

The dashboard has been revamped completely, introducing a sidebar that pops out when viewing information about your transfers.

It is fully mobile-friendly now as well, meaning that you can send files on the go.

### New Landing Page

We completely overhauled the landing page to ensure that everything looks and feels more modern, increasing the conversion rate.

The user interface now boasts a sleek, minimalist aesthetic, providing a more intuitive and visually pleasing experience. 

For reference, this is how the landing page looked before the update:
